lambdaControl(lambda0 = 0, lambda1 = 0)

selectControl(
  lambda0_seq = NULL,
  lambda1_seq = NULL,
  nlambda = 10,
  search = c("abbrev", "full_grid"),
  BIC_option = c("BICq", "BICh", "BIC", "BICNgrp"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda0}{a non-negative numeric penalty parameter for the fixed effects parameters}

\item{lambda1}{a non-negative numeric penalty parameter for the (grouped) random effects
covariance parameters}

\item{lambda0_seq, lambda1_seq}{a sequence of non-negative numeric penalty parameters for the fixed 
and random effect parameters, respectively. If \code{NULL}, then a sequence will be automatically 
calculated. See 'Details' section for more details on these default calculations.}

\item{nlambda}{positive integer specifying number of penalty parameters (lambda) with which to fit a model.
Ignored if \code{lambda0_seq} and \code{lambda1_seq} are specified by the user.}

\item{search}{character string of "abbrev" (default) or "full_grid" indicating if the search of models over 
the penalty parameter space should be the full grid search (total number of models equals
`nlambda`^2 or length(`lambda0_seq`)*length(`lambda1_seq`)) or an abbreviated grid search.
The abbreviated grid search is described in more detail in the Details section.}

\item{BIC_option}{character string specifing the selection criteria used to select the 'best' model.
Default "BICq" option specifies the BIC-ICQ criterion, which requires a fit of 
a full model; a small penalty of 0.001*(lambda max) is used for the fixed and/or random effects if the number of 
effects is 10 or greater. The "BICh" option utilizes the hybrid BIC value described in Delattre, Lavielle, and Poursat (2014).
The regular "BIC" option penalty term uses (total non-zero coefficients)*(length(y) = total number
observations). The "BICNgrp" option penalty term uses (total non-zero coefficients)*(nlevels(group) = number
groups).}

\item{logLik_calc}{logical value specifying if the log likelihood (and log-likelihood based 
calculations BIC, BICh, and BICNgrp) should be calculated for all of the models in the selection procedure. 
If BIC-ICQ is used for selection, the log-likelihood is not needed. However, if users are interested
in comparing the best models from BIC-ICQ and other BIC-type selection criteria, setting
\code{logLik_calc} to \code{TRUE} will calculate these other options for all of the models.}

\item{lambda.min}{numeric fraction between 0 and 1. The sequence of the lambda penalty parameters
ranges from the maximum lambda where all fixed and random effects are penalized to 0 and 
a minimum lambda value, which equals a small fraction of the maximum lambda. The parameter 
\code{lambda.min} specifiex this fraction. Default value is set to \code{NULL}, which
automatically selects \code{lambda.min} to equal 0.01 when n < p and 0.05 when p >= n.}

\item{pre_screen}{logical value indicating whether pre-screening should be performed before
model selection (default \code{TRUE}). If the number of random effects considered less than 5,
no pre-screening will be performed. Pre-screening removes random effects from consideration
during the model selection process, which can significantly speed up the algorithm.}

\item{lambda.min.presc}{numeric fraction between 0 and 1. During pre-screening and the full
model fit for the BIC-ICQ calculation, the small penalty used on the random effect is
the fraction \code{lambda.min.presc} mulitplied by the maximum penalty parameter that penalizes
all fixed and random effects to 0. If left as \code{NULL}, the default value is 0.01 when the number
of random effects is 10 or less and 0.05 otherwise.}
}
\value{
The *Control functions return a list (inheriting from class "\code{pglmmControl}") 
containing parameter values that determine settings for variable selection.

\details{
If unspecified, the \code{lambda0_seq} and \code{lambda1_seq} numeric sequences are 
automatically calculated. The sequence will be calculated in the same manner as 
\code{ncvreg} calculates the range: max penalizes all fixed and random effects to 0, min is a 
small portion of max (\code{lambda.min}*(lambda max)), sequence is composed of 
\code{nlambda} values spread evenly on the log scale. Unlike \code{ncvreg}, the order of penalty
values used in the algorithm must run from the min lambda to the max lambda (as opposed to 
running from max lambda to min lambda). The length of the sequence is specified by \code{nlambda}. 
By default, these sequences are calculated using \code{\link{LambdaSeq}}.

For secondary rounds run using \code{\link{glmmPen_FineSearch}}, the optimal lambda combination 
from the initial round (based on the specified \code{BIC_option}) will be used to calculate a 
finer grid search. The new max and min lambda values are the lambda values \code{idx_lambda} 
positions away from the best lambda in the original lambda sequences for the fixed and random
effects.

The \code{lambda0} and \code{lambda1} arguments allow for a user to fit a model with a single 
non-zero penalty parameter combination. However, this is generally not recommended. 

Abbreviated grid search: The abbreviated grid search proceeds in two stages. In stage 1, the
algorithm fits the following series of models: the fixed effects penalty parameter remains a
fixed value evaluated at the minimum of the fixed effects penalty parameters, and a all
random effects penalty parameters are examined. The 'best' model from this first stage of models
determines the optimum random effect penalty parameter. In stage 2, the algorithm fits the 
following series of models: the random effects penalty parameter remains fixed at the value of
the optimum random effect penalty parameter (from stage 1) and all fixed effects penalty
parameters are considered. The best overall model is the best model from stage 2. This reduces the 
number of models considered to length(`lambda0_seq`) + length(`lambda1_seq`). Although this
can drastically increase the time of the algorithm to proceed, the authors found in simulations
that this generally increases the false positive rate by a factor of between 1.5 and 2.
